# codebug-load
Batch file to automatically load .cbg files directly to CodeBug

This batch file can be associated with CodeBug .cbg files, so they can be directly opened
from the web browser (it works with Chrome at least) and automatically transferred onto
the CodeBug. It avoids having to open a browser window, locate the CodeBug, and drag and
drop the file onto it every time.
